/**

 * the original player yet as the program is still running and I think it will
 * be useful to have a copy of it so I can see exactly how it worked. The new
 * AI also has nodes for counting the numebr of turns each player is in jail
 * for. I will put nodes in to represent the number of get out of jail cards
 * owned by each player.
